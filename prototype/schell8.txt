But I do understand how to use the de Borglie equation in a problem.

In the example we draw vectors of charge from the sphere to the point. And it didn't seem to matter plus or minus charge for the ball since the force vectors all pointed one way. But the audio said resultant to what type of charge  the point charge would travel in seperate directions, which seems to me to dictate a force arrow being drawn differently depending on electrical charge of the object.

Logically, if I have an acceleration formula and I want to know the velocity, I know that I need to integrate (because you took the derivative of the velocity to get the acceleration). But I was really confused about how the video presented the arguement. That being said, I normally enjoy the videos and they help alot. I also enjoyed the political graphs video as well.

Particulary in the last practice question- I was not sure if ln(a) and ln(b+c) were to be divided by two in order for them both to fall under the square root once the properties were applied.  I found this to be a very helpful review on how to solve for inverses. The idea that the domain and range are simply flipped helps me understand the concept best.  <!--EndFragment-->
